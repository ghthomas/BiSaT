# BiSaT
Biodiversity in Space and Time

This is a utlity package with functions to create and work with presence-absence matrices in R. BiSaT relies heavily on the `sf` package.

# To do

1. Extend pam_to_raster to take species values and calculate grid cell mean, median, variance etc. Also look at adding metrics from the dispRity package.
2. Add function to calculate species averages of e.g. temperature, from range data.
3. Functions for clustering (e.g to estimate realms).
4. Add test function(s) to try idea for "biogeographic" autocorrelation method.
